module Exchange
  
  # The external API module. Every class Handling an API has to be placed here and inherit from base. It has to call an api and define
  # a rates hash, an exchange base and a unix timestamp. The call will get cached automatically with the right structure
  # Allows for easy extension with an own api, as shown below
  # @author Beat Richartz
  # @version 0.1
  # @since 0.1
  # @example Easily connect to your custom API by writing an ExternalAPI Class
  #   module Exchange
  #     module ExternalAPI
  #
  #       # Inherit from Json to write for a json api, and the json gem is automatically loaded
  #       # Inherit from XML to write for an xml api, and nokogiri is automatically loaded
  #       # 
  #       class MyCustom < Json
  #         
  #         # Define here which currencies your API can handle
  #         #
  #         CURRENCIES = %W(usd chf).map(&:to_sym)
  #         
  #         # Every instance of ExternalAPI Class has to have an update function which 
  #         # gets the rates from the API
  #         #
  #         def update(opts={})
  #
  #           # assure that you will get a Time object for the historical dates
  #           #
  #           time = helper.assure_time(opts[:at]) 
  #
  #           # Call your API (shown here with a helper function that builds your API URL). 
  #           # Like this, your calls will get cached.
  #           #
  #           Call.new(api_url(time), :at => time) do |result|
  # 
  #           # Assign the currency conversion base.
  #           # Attention, this is readonly, self.base= won't work
  #           #
  #           @base                 = result['base']
  # 
  #           # assign the rates, this has to be a hash with the following format: 
  #           # {'USD' => 1.23242, 'CHF' => 1.34323}. 
  #           #
  #           # Attention, this is readonly, self.rates= won't work
  #           #
  #           @rates                = result['rates']
  # 
  #           # Timestamp the api call result. This may come in handy to assure you have 
  #           # the right result. 
  #           #
  #           # Attention, this is readonly, self.timestamp= won't work
  #           #
  #           @timestamp            = result['timestamp'].to_i
  #
  #         end
  #         
  #         private
  #
  #           def api_url(time)
  #             # code a helper function that builds your api url for the specified time
  #           end
  #
  #       end
  #     end
  #   end
  #
  #   # Now, you can configure your API in the configuration. The Symbol will get camelcased and constantized
  #   #
  #   Exchange::Configuration.api.subclass = :my_custom
  #
  #   # Have fun, and don't forget to write tests.
